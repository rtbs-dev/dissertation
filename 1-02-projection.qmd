# Projection between Complex System Representations

I.e. trying to "recover" one from the other.
In a way, expounds on the precautions described in @WhyHowWhen_Torres2021. 

## Connecting Graph & Hypergraph Observations
Operates on the data space itself

### Bipartite Projection

Various ways of "counting" edges from nodes. 

### Sparse Approximations
and relation to deconvolution?

It's what we will use, up next

## Manipulation of Kernels

Modifies the inner products directly, without using the data as-observed

### Network Backboning
trimming the hairball

Note ensemble methods do use data, but are not generative. 

### Convariance, Precision, & Shrinkage

I.e. GLasso.

This is defetinitely the problem we want to solve, but is not estimating uncertainty (barring cross-validation-style bootstrapping)
