# Review: Projections and Inverse Problems

I.e. trying to "recover" one from the other.
In a way, proceduralizing the precautions described in @WhyHowWhen_Torres2021. 

> Takeaway: a way to organize existing algorithms, AND highlight unique set of problems we set out to solve


## Connecting Graphs \& Hypergraphs as Adjoint

i.e. Network Recovery as an Inverse Problem

## Algorithmic Information Loss in Literature 

- Observation-level loss (starting with the inner product or kernel)
- Non-generative model loss (no projection of data into model space)
- no uncertainty quantification 

Sorting algorithms... _none address all three!_

i.e. MOTIVATES FOREST PURSUIT
