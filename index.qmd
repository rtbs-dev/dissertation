> DISCLAIMER FOR PRIOR WORK

Portions of @sec-desirepath, @sec-fp, @sec-extend, along with network figures from @sec-qual and @sec-ordered, are planned for submission to PLOS _Complex Systems_ later this year.  

@sec-fp references `MENDR`, a standard reference dataset and test-bench for network recovery algorithms created in the course of completing this thesis.
It is awaiting DOI assignment through NIST internal review processes.
Likewise for `affinis`, a python library for dependency inference from binary activations containing our reference implementations of various algorithms (including _Forest Pursuit_).

Portions of @sec-ordered involving INVITE and recovery from partially ordered node sets are taken from @OrganizingTaggedKnowledge_Sexton2020 in the Journal of Mechanical Design, and its predecessor @UsingSemanticFluency_Sexton2019 from the 45th ASME Design Automation Conference.
