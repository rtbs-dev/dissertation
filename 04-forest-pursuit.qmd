# Nonparametric Network Recovery With Random Spanning Forests 

> filling the gap we saw in the literature

## Generative Model Specification

![Explanation of the Random Spanning Forest generative model for binary activation observations](images/random-spanning-forests.png)


## Forest Pursuit: Approximate Recovery in Near-linear Time

I.e. the PLOS paper (modified basis-pursuit via MSTs)

## Bayesian Estimation by Gibbs Sampling 

I.e. the unwritten paper, modifying technique by @BayesianSpanningTree_Duan2021 for RSF instead of RSTs
