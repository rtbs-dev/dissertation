\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

A wide variety of fields show consistent interest in inferring latent
network structure from observed interactions, from human cognition and
social infection networks, to marketing, traffic, finance, and many
others. \autocite{Inferringnetworksdiffusion_GomezRodriguez2012}
However, an increasing number of authors are noting a lack of agreement
in how to approach the metrology of this problem. This includes rampant
disconnects between the theoretical and methodological network analysis
sub-communities\autocite{Statisticalinferencelinks_Peel2022}, treatment
of error as purely aleatory, rather than epistemic
\autocite{Measurementerrornetwork_Wang2012}, or simply ignoring
measurement error in network reconstruction
entirely\autocite{ReconstructingNetworksUnknown_Peixoto2018}.

\section{Ambiguous Metrology}\label{ambiguous-metrology}

Networks in the ``wild'' rarely exist of and by themsleves. Rather, they
are a model of interaction or relation \emph{between} things that were
observed. One of the most beloved examples of a network, the famed
\emph{Zachary's Karate Club}\autocite{InformationFlowModel_Zachary1977},
is in fact reported as a list of pairwise interactions: every time a
club member interacted with another (outside of the club), Zachary
recorded it as two integers (the IDs of the members). The final list of
pairs can be \emph{interpreted} as an ``edge list'', which can be
modeled with a network: a simple graph. This was famously used to show
natural community structure that nicely matches the group separation
that eventually took place when the club split into
two.\autocite{Communitystructuresocial_Girvan2002}

Note, however, that we could have just as easily taken note of the
instigating student for each interaction (i.e.~which student initiated
conversation, or invited the other to socialize, etc.). If that
relational asymmetry is available, our ``edges'' are now
\emph{directed}, and we might be able to ask questions about the rates
that certain students are asked vs.~do the asking, and what that implies
about group cohesion. Additionally, the time span is assumed to be ``for
the duration of observation'' (did the students \emph{ever} interact),
but if observation time was significantly longer, say, multiple years,
we might question the credulity of treating a social interaction 2 years
ago as equally important to an interaction immediately preceding the
split. This is now a ``dynamic'' graph; or, if we only measure relative
to the time of separation, at the very least a ``weighted'' one.

}

\caption{\label{fig-karate-club}Zachary's Karate Club, with ambiguously
extant edge 78 highlighted.}

\end{figure}%

\emph{We do not know if any of these are true}. In fact, as illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig-karate-club}, we do not know if the network being
described from the original edge data even has 77 or 78 edges, due to
ambiguous reporting in the original work. Lacking a precise definition
of what the graph's components (i.e.~it's edges) are, \emph{as
measurable entities}, means we cannot estimate the measurement error in
the graph.

\section{Indirect Network
Measurement}\label{indirect-network-measurement}

While the karate club graph has unquantified edge uncertainty derived
from ambiguous edge measurements, we are fortunate that we \emph{have
edge measurements}. Regardless of how the data was collected, it is de
facto reported as a list of pairs. In many cases, we simply do not have
such luxury. Instead, our edges are only measured \emph{indirectly}, and
instead we are left with lists of node co-ocurrences. Networks
connecting movies as being ``similar'' might be derived from data that
lists sets of movies watched by each user; networks of disease spread
pathways might be implied from patient infection records; famously, we
might build a network of collaboration strength between academic authors
by mining datasets of the papers they co-author together.

Such networks are derived from what we will call \emph{node activation}
data, i.e., records of what entities happened ``together'', whether
contemporaneously, or in some other context or artifact.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{index_files/mediabag/content/0-intro_files/figure-latex/codefigs-graphs-fig-obs-set-output-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-obs-set}}

\end{figure}%

These are naturally represented as ``bipartite'' networks, having
separate entites for, say, ``papers'' and ``authors'', and connecting
them with edges (paper 1 is ``connected'' to its authors E,H,C, etc.).
But analysts are typically seeking the collaboration network connecting
authors (or papers) themselves! Networks of relationships in this
situation are not directly observed, but which \emph{if recovered} could
provide estimates for community structure, importances of individual
authors (e.g.~as controlling flow of information), and the ``distances''
that separate authors from each other, in their respective domains.
\autocite{Scientificcollaborationnetworks._Newman2001} Common practice
assumes that co-authorship in any paper is sufficient evidence of at
least some level of social ``acquaintance'', where more papers shared
means more ``connected''.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{index_files/mediabag/content/0-intro_files/figure-latex/codefigs-graphs-fig-collab-output-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-collab}}

\end{figure}%

Thus our social collaboration network is borne out of indirect
measurements: author connection is implied through ``occasions when
co-authorship occurred''. However, authors of papers may recall times
that others were added, not by their choice, but by someone else already
involved. In fact, the final author list of most papers is reasonably a
result of individuals choosing to invite others, not a unanimous,
simultaneous decision by all members. Let's imagine we wished to study
the social network of collaboration more directly: if we had the luxury
of being in situ as, say, a sociologist performing an academic
ethnography, we might have been more strict with our definition of
``connection''. If the goal is a meaningful social network reflecting
the strength of interraction between colleages, perhaps the we prefer
our edges represent ``mutual willingness to collaborate''. Edge
``measurement'', then, could involve records of events that show
willingness to seek or participate in collaboration event, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{author (g) asked (e), (h), and (c) to co-author a paper, all of
  whom agreed}
\item
  \emph{(i) asked (f) and (j), but (j) wanted to add (b)'s expertise
  before writing one of the sections}
\end{itemize}

and so on. Each time two colleagues had an opportunity to work together
\emph{and it was seized upon} we might conclude that evidence of their
relationship strengthed. With data like this, we could be more confident
in claiming our collaboration network can serve as ``ground truth,'' as
far as empirically confirmed collaborations go. However, even if the
underlying ``activations'' are identical, our new, directly measured
graph looks very different.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{index_files/mediabag/content/0-intro_files/figure-latex/codefigs-graphs-fig-colleague-output-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-colleague}graph of mutual collaboration
relationships i.e.~the ``ground truth'' social network}

\end{figure}%

Fundamentally, the network in Figure~\ref{fig-colleague} shows which
relationships the authors \emph{depend} on to accomplish their
publishing activity. When causal relations between nodes are being
modeled as edges, we call such a graph a \emph{dependency network}. We
will investigate this idea further later on, but ultimately, if a
network of dependencies is desired (or implied, based on analysis
needs), then the critical problem remaining is \emph{how do we recover
dependency networks from node activations?} Additionally, what goes
wrong when we use co-occurence/activation data to estimate the
dependency network, especially when we wish to use it for metrics like
centrality, shortest path distances, and community belonging?

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{\label{fig-recover}Recovering underlying dependency networks
from node-cooccurrences.}

\end{figure}%

Even more practically, networks created directly from bipartite-style
data are notorious for quickly becoming far too dense for useful
analysis, earning them the (not-so-)loving moniker ``hairballs''.
Network ``backboning,'' as it has come to be called tries to find a
subset of edges in this hairball that still captures it's core topology
in a way that's easier to
visualize.\autocite{twostagealgorithm_Slater2009,backbonebipartiteprojections_Neal2014}
Meanwhile, underlying networks of dependencies that \emph{cause} node
activation patterns can provide this: they are almost always more sparse
than their hairballs. Accessing the dependency \emph{backbone} in a
principled way is difficult, but doing so in a rapid, scalable manner is
critical for practitioners to be able to make use of it to trim their
hairballs.

\section{Scope of this work}\label{scope-of-this-work}

The purpose of this thesis is to provide a solid foundation for basic
edge metrology when our data consists of binary node activations, by
framing network analysis as a problem of \emph{inference}, as suggested
by \textcite{Statisticalinferencelinks_Peel2022}. We give special focus
to binary activations that occur due to spreading processes, such as
random walks or cascades on an underlying carrier graph. Recovering the
carrier, or, ``dependency'' network from node activations is of great
interest to the network backboning and causal modeling communities, but
often involves either unspoken sources of epistemic and aleatory error,
or high computation costs (or both). To begin addressing these issues,
we present a guide to current practices, pitfalls, and how common
statistical tools apply to the network recovery problem: a
\emph{Practitioner's Guide to Network Recovery}. We cover what
``measurement'' means in our context, and specifically the ways we
encode observations, operations, and uncertainties numerically.
Clarifying what different versions of what ``relation'' means (whether
proximity or incidence) is critical, since network structure is intended
to encode such relations as mathematical objects, despite common
ambiguities and confusion around what practitioners intend on
communicating through them. Then we use this structure to present a
cohesive framework for selecting a useful network recovery technique,
based on the available data and where in the data processing pipeline is
acceptable to admit either extra modeling assumptions or information
loss.

Next, building on a gap found in the first part, we present a novel
method, \emph{Forest Pursuit}, to extract dependency networks when we
know a \emph{spreading process} causes node activation (e.g.~paper
co-authorship caused by collaboration requests). We create a new
reference dataset to enable community benchmarking of network recovery
techniques, and use it show greatly improved accuracy over many other
widely-used methods. Forest Pursuit in its simplest form scales linearly
with the size of active-node sets, being trivially parallelizable and
streamable over dataset size, and agnostic to network size overall. We
then expand our analysis to re-imagine Forest Pursuit as a Bayesian
probabilistic model, \emph{Latent Forest Allocation}, which has an
easily-implemented Expectation Maximization scheme for posterior
estimation. This significantly improves upon the accuracy results of
Forest Pursuit, at the cost of some speed and scalability, giving
analysts multiple options to adapt to their needs.

Last, we apply Forest Pursuit to several qualitative case-studies,
including a scientific collaboration network, and the verbal fluency
``animals'' network recovery problem, which dramatically change
interpretation under use of our method. We investigate its use as a
low-cost preprocessor for other methods of network recovery,like GLASSO,
improving their stability and interpretability. Finally we discuss the
special case when node activations are reported as an ordered set, where
accounting for cascade-like effects becomes crucial to balance false
positive and false-negative edge prediction. Along with application of
this idea to knowledge-graph creation from technical language in the
form maintenance work-order data, we discuss more broadly the future
needs of network recovery, specifically in the context of embeddings and
gradient-based machine learning toolkits.

\chapter{Metrology as matrices}\label{metrology-as-matrices}

Where metrology is concerned, the actual unit of observation and how it
is encoded for us is critical to how analysts may proceed with
quantifying, modeling, and measuring uncertainty around observed
phenomena. Experiment and observation tends to be organized as inputs
and outputs, or, independent variables and dependent variables,
specifically. Independent variables are observed, multiple times
(``observations''), and changes in outcome for each can be compared to
the varying values associated with the independent variable input
(``features''). For generality, say a practitioner records their
measurements as scalar values,
i.e.~\(x\in\mathbb{S}\in\{\mathbb{R,Z,N},\cdots\}\). The structure most
often used to record scalar values of \(n\) independent/input variable
features over the course of \(m\) observations is called a design matrix
\(X:\mathbb{S}^{m\times n}\).\footnote{ Not all observations are scalar,
  but they can become so. If individual measurements are
  higher-dimensional (e.g.~images are 2D), X is a tensor, which can be
  transformed through unrolling or embedding into a lower dimensional
  representation before proceeding. There are other techniques for
  dealing with e.g.~categorical data, such as one-hot encoding (where
  the features are binary for each possible category, with boolean
  entries for each observation).}

\section{Observation and feature ``spaces''}\label{sec-matrix-notation}

If we index a set of observations and features, respectively, as
\[ i\in I=\{1,\cdots,m\}, \quad j\in J=\{1,\cdots,n\},\qquad I,J:\mathbb{N}\]
then the design matrix can map the index of an observation and a feature
to the corresponding measurement.
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-design-mat}{
x=X(i,j)\qquad X : I\times J \rightarrow \mathbb{S}
}\end{equation} i.e.~the measured value of the \(j\)th independent
variable from the \(i\)th observation.\footnote{ This notation is
  adapted from the sparse linear algebraic treatment of graphs in
  \textcite{GraphAlgorithmsLanguage_Kepner2011} and
  \textcite{MathematicalfoundationsGraphBLAS_Kepner2016}.} In this
scheme, an ``observation'' is a single row vector of features in
\(\mathbb{S}^{n\times 1}\) (or simply \(\mathbb{S}^{n}\)), such that
each observation encodes a position in the space defined by the
features, i.e.~the \emph{feature space}, and extracting a specific
observation vector \(i\) from the entire matrix can be denoted as
\[\mathbf{x}_i=X(i,\cdot),\quad \mathbf{x}:J\rightarrow\mathbb{S}\]
Similarly, every ``feature'' is associated with a single column vector
in \(\mathbb{S}^{1\times m}\), which can likewise be interpreted as a
position in the space of observations (the \emph{data space}):
\[\mathbf{x}_j'=X(\cdot,j),\quad \mathbf{x}':I\rightarrow\mathbb{S}\]
Note that this definition could be swapped without loss of generality.
In other words, \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{x}'\) being in row and
column spaces is somewhat arbitrary, having more to do with the
logistics of experiment design and data collection. We could have
measured our feature vectors one-at-a-time, measuring their values over
an entire ``population'', in effect treating that as the independent
variable set.\footnote{ In fact, vectors are often said to be in the
  column-space of a matrix, especially when using them as
  transformations in physics or deep learning layers. We generally
  follow a one-observation-per-row rule, unless otherwise stated.}

To illustrate this formalism in a relevant domain, let's take another
look at co-citation networks. For \(m\) papers we might be aware of
\(n\) total authors. For a given paper, we are able to see which authors
are involved, and we say those authors ``activated'' for that paper. It
makes sense that our observations are individual papers, while the
features might be the set of possible authors. However, we are not given
information about which author was invited by which other one, or when
each author signed on. In other words, the measured values are strictly
boolean, and we can structure our dataset as a design matrix
\(X:\mathbb{B}^{m\times n}\). We can then think of the
\(i^{\mathrm{th}}\) paper as being represented by a vector
\(\mathbf{x}_i:\mathbb{B}^n\), and proceed using it in our various
statistical models. If we desired to analyze the set of authors, say, in
order to determine their relative neighborhoods or latent author
communities, we could equally use the feature vectors for each paper,
this time represented in a vector
\(\mathbf{x}'_j:\mathbb{B}^{1\times m}\).

\section{Models \& linear operators}\label{sec-lin-ops}

Another powerful tool an analyst has is \emph{modeling} the observation
process. This is relevant when the observed data is hypothesized to be
generated by a process we can represent mathematically, but we do not
know the parameter values to best represent the observations (or the
observations are ``noisy'' and we want to find a ``best'' parameters
that account for this noise). This is applicable to much of scientific
inquiry, though one common use-case is the de-blurring of observed
images (or de-noising of signals), since we might have a model for how
blurring ``operated'' on the original image to give us the blurred one.
We call this ``blurring'' a \emph{linear operator} if it can be
represented as a matrix\footnote{in the finite-dimensional case}, and
applying it to a model with \(l\) parameters is called the \emph{forward
map}:
\[\mathbf{x} = F\mathbf{p}\qquad F:\mathbb{R}^{l}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\]
where \(P\) is the space of possible parameter vectors, i.e.~the
\emph{model space}. The forward map takes a modeled vector and predicts
a location in data space.

Of critical importance, then, is our ability to recover some model
parameters from our observed data, e.g.~if our images were blurred
through convolution with a blurring kernel, then we are interested in
\emph{deconvolution}. If \(F\) is invertible, the most direct solution
might be to apply the operator to the data, as the \emph{adjoint map}:
\[ \mathbf{p} = F^H\mathbf{x}\qquad F^H:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^l\]
which removes the effect of \(F\) from the data \(\mathbf{x}\) to
recover the desired model \(\mathbf{p}\).

Trivially we might have an orthogonal matrix \(F\), so \(F^H=F^{-1}\) is
available directly. In practice, other approaches are used to minimize
the \emph{residual}:
\(\hat{\mathbf{p}}^=\min_{\mathbf{p}} F\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{x}\). Setting
the gradient to 0 yields the normal equation, such that
\[ \hat{\mathbf{p}}=(F^TF)^{-1}F^T\mathbf{x}\] This should be familiar
to readers as equivalent to solving ordinary least-squares (OLS).
However, in that case it is more often shown as having the \emph{design
matrix} \(X\) in place of the operator \(F\).

\emph{This is a critical distinction to make:} OLS as a ``supervised''
learning method treats some of the observed data we represented as a
design matrix previously as a target to be modeled, \(y=X(\cdot,j)\),
and the rest maps parameters into data space, \(F=X(\cdot,J/j)\). With
this paradigm, only the target is being ``modeled'' and the rest of the
data is used to create the operator. In the citation network example, it
would be equivalent to trying to predict one variable, like citation
count or a specific author's participation in every paper, \emph{given}
every other author's participation in them.

For simplicity, most work in the supervised setting treats the reduced
data matrix as X, opting to treat \(y\) as a separate \emph{dependent
variable}. However, our setting will remain \emph{unsupervised}, since
no single target variable is of specific interest---all observations are
``data''. In this, we more closely align with the deconvolution
literature, such that we are seeking a model and an operation on it that
will produce the observed behavior in an ``optimal'' way.

\section{Measurement quantification \& error}\label{sec-smooth-err}

In binary data, such as what we have been considering, it is common to
model observables as so-called ``Bernoulli trials'': events with two
possible outcomes (on, off; yes, no; true, false), and one outcome has
probability \(p\). These can be thought of as weighted coin-flips:
``heads'' with probability \(p\), and ``tails'' \(1-p\). If \(k\) trials
are performed (the ``exposure''), we say the number of successes \(s\)
(the ``count'') is distributed as a binomial distribution
\(s\sim Bin(p,k)\). The empirical estimate for the success probability
is \(\hat{p}=\tfrac{s}{k}\).

Note that this naturally resembles marginal sums on our design matrix
\(X\), if we treat columns (or rows!) as an array of samples from
independent Bernoulli trials:
\(\hat{p}_j = \frac{\sum_{i\in I} X(i,j)}{m}\). Many probability
estimates involving repeated measurements of binary variables (not
simply the row/column variables) have this sort of
\(\frac{\textrm{count}}{\textrm{exposure}}\) structure, as will become
useful in later sections.

However, if we are ``measuring'' a probability, we run into issues when
we need to quantify our uncertainty about it. For instance, an event
might be quite rare, but if in our specific sample we \emph{never} see
it, we still do not generally accept a probability of zero.

\subsection{Additive Smoothing}\label{sec-counting}

One approach to dealing with this involves adding \emph{pseudocounts}
that smooth out our estimates for count/exposure, from which we get the
name ``additive smoothing''.{[}CITE?{]}
\[\hat{p} = \frac{s+\alpha}{k+2\alpha} \] Adding 1 success and 1 failure
(\(\alpha=1\)) as pseudocounts to our observations is called
\emph{Laplace's Rule of Succession}, or simply ``Laplace
smoothing,''\footnote{ derived when Laplace desired estimates of
  probability for unobserved phenomena, such as the sun (not) rising
  tomorrow.} while adding \(\alpha=0.5\) successes and failures is
called using \emph{Jeffrey's Prior}. It's so-called because this
pseudocount turns out to be a special case of selecting a Beta prior on
the Bernoulli probability \(p\sim \textrm{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)\), such
that the posterior distribution for \(p\) after our observations is
\(\textrm{Beta}(s+\alpha, k-s+\beta)\), which has the mean:
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-beta-binomial}{
E[p|s,k]=\frac{s+\alpha}{k-\alpha+\beta}
}\end{equation}

This exactly recovers additive smoothing with a Jeffrey's prior for
\(\alpha=\beta=0.5\).\footnote{ A useful comparison of the two priors
  (1, 0.5) is to ask, given all of the trials we have seen so far,
  whether we believe we are near the ``end'' or ``middle'' of an average
  run of trials. For \(\alpha=1\), we believe nearly all evidence has
  been collected, but for \(\alpha=0.5\), only half of expected evidence
  has been observed.\\
} This generalization allows us to be more flexible, and specify our
prior expectations on counts or exposure with more precision. Such
models provide both an estimate of the aleatory uncertainty (via the
posterior distribution), and a form of ``shrinkage'' that prevents
sampling noise from unduly affecting parameter estimates (via the prior
distribution). Despite being a simple foundation, this treatment of
``counts'' and ``exposure'' can be built upon in many ways.

\subsection{Conditional Probabilities \&
Contingencies}\label{conditional-probabilities-contingencies}

In dependency/structure recovery, since our goal involves estimating (at
least) pairwise relationships, the independence assumption required to
estimate node occurrences as Beta-Binomial is clearly
violated.\footnote{ In fact, a recent method from
  \autocite{MultivariateBernoullidistribution_Dai2013} models
  probabilistic binary observations, \emph{with dependencies}, by
  generalizing the mechanics overviewed here to a fully multivariate
  Bernoulli distribution, capable of including 3rd- and higher-order
  interractions, not just pairwise.\\
}

However, it's common to estimate how similar two random variables
\(A,B\) are, e.g.~if samples of each correspond to columns of binary
\(X\). For instance, the joint probabilities \(P(A\cap B)\) answer ``how
often does A happen with B, out of all data?'' Conditional probabilities
\(P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}\) measure how often A occures given B
happened. Once again, we can estimate the base probabilities \(P(A)\)
and \(P(B)\) with methods like Equation~\ref{eq-beta-binomial} for each
marginal sums \(X(\cdot,A)\) or \(X(\cdot,B)\), but the joint and
conditional probabilities can instead be estimated using matrix
multiplication using the Gram matrix, discussed below. It encodes
pair-wise co-occurrence counts, such that
\(G(i,i'):\mathbb{Z}^{n\times n}\) has the co-occurrence count for node
\(i\) with \(i'\).

The co-occurrence probability \(P(A\cap B)\) for each pair can also be
approximated with the beta-binomial scheme mentioned above, but care
must be taken not to confuse this with the edge strength connecting two
nodes. First, nodes that rarely activate (low node probability) may
nonetheless reliably connect to others when they do occur (high edge
probability). In fact, without direct observation of edges, we are not
able to estimate their count, \emph{or} their exposure, which can be a
source of systemic error from \emph{epistemic uncertainty}. We don't
know when edges are used, directly, and we also don't have a reliable
way to estimate the opportunities each edge had to activate (their
exposure), either. This is especially true when we wish to know whether
an edge even \emph{can} be traversed, i.e.~the edge \emph{support}.
Support, as used in this sense, is the set of inputs for which we expect
a non-zero output. Intuitively, this idea captures the sense that we
might care more about \emph{whether} an edge/dependency exists, not
\emph{how important} it is. For that, we have to re-assess our simple
model: even if we could count the number of times an edge might have
been traversed, how do we estimate the opportunities it had to be
available for traversal (it's ``exposure'')?

Assuming this kind of epistemic uncertainty can be adequately addressed
through modeling---attempts at which will be discussed in more detail in
Chapter~\ref{sec-lit-review}---conditional probability/contingency
tables will again be useful for validation. When comparing estimated
edge probability to some known ``true'' edge existence (if we have
that), we can count the number of correct predictions, as well as type I
(false positive) and type II (false negative) errors. We can do this at
\emph{every probability/weight threshold value}, as well, and we will
return to ways to aggregate all of these values into useful scoring
metrics in Section~\ref{sec-FP-experiments}.

\section{Distance vs.~Incidence}\label{sec-products}

As we have already seen, operations from linear algebra make many
counting and combinatoric tasks easier, while unifying disparate
concepts to a common set of mechanics. In addition to having a map from
integer indices to sets of interest, these design matrices/vectors are
implicitly assumed to have entries that exist in a field
\(F=(\mathbb{S},\oplus,\otimes)\). equipped with operators analogous to
addition (\(\oplus\)) and multiplication (\(\otimes\)).\footnote{ Or,
  more generally, a semiring if inverse operations for
  \(\oplus,\otimes\) don't exist.} With this, we are able to define
generalized inner products that take pairs vectors in a vector space
\(\mathbf{x}\in V\), such that
\(\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_F:\mathbb{S}^n\times \mathbb{S}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{S}\).
\[
\langle\mathbf{x}_a,\mathbf{x}_b\rangle_{F} = \bigoplus_{j=1}^n \mathbf{x}_a(j)\otimes\mathbf{x}_b(j)
\]

We can use this to perform ``contractions'' along any matching
dimensions of matrices as well, since the sum index is well-defined. \[
\begin{aligned}
X\in\mathbb{S}^{m\times n}\quad Y\in\mathbb{S}^{n\times m} \\
Z(i,j)=X\oplus,\otimes Y = \bigoplus_{j=1}^{n} X(i,j) \otimes Y(j,k) = XY
\end{aligned}
\] For ease-of-use, we will assume the standard field for any given set
\((\mathbb{S},+,\times)\) if not specified otherwise, which recovers
standard inner products \(\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle\). However,
\textcite{MathematicalfoundationsGraphBLAS_Kepner2016} illustrates the
usefulness of various fields (or semirings). They allow linear-algebraic
representation of many graph operations, such as shortest paths through
inner products over \((\mathbb{R}\cup -\infty,\textrm{min}, +)\). This
works because discrete/boolean edge weights will not accumulate extra
strength beyond 1 under contraction over observations.

\subsection{Kernels \& distances}\label{kernels-distances}

As alluded to in the previous section, co-occurrence have a deep
connection to a Gram matrix, which is a matrix of all pairwise inner
products over a set of vectors.

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-gram-mat}{
X^TX=G(j,j')=\langle\mathbf{x'}_j,\mathbf{x}_{j'}'\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{m} X(i,j)X(i,j')
}\end{equation}

Matrices that can be decomposed into another matrix and its transpose
are symmetric, and positive semidefinite (PSD), making every gram matrix
PSD. They are directly related to (squared) euclidean distances through
the polarization identity{[}CITE?{]}:\footnote{\textbf{Important}: these
  definitions are all using the \(\mathbf{x}'\) notation to indicate
  that these measurements are almost exclusively being done in the
  \emph{data space}, i.e.~on column vectors. While most definitions work
  on distances in terms of the measurements/objects/data, for
  \emph{inverse problems} (like network recovery, structure learning,
  etc.) they are more often applied in terms of the features (here, the
  nodes. This can be seen in statistics as well, where covariance and
  correlation matrices (which are related to the gram and distance
  matrix definitions above), are defined as relationships between
  features/dimensions, not individual samples.}
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-sq-distance}{
d^2(j,j') = \|\mathbf{x}_{j'}'-\mathbf{x}_{j'}'\|^2 = G(j,j) - 2G(j,j') + G(j',j') 
}\end{equation}

In our example from before, the gram matrix will have entries showing
the number of papers shared by two authors (or total papers by each, on
the diagonal). This is because an inner product between two author
(column) vectors will add 1 for each paper in the sum only if it has
both authors in common. This is called a \emph{bipartite
projection}{[}CITE{]} into the authors ``mode'', and is illustrated
visually in Figure~\ref{fig-collab}.

Due to {[}CITE Shoenberg/Mercer{]}, we can generalize
Equation~\ref{eq-sq-distance} such that \emph{any} function ``kernel''
function \(\kappa(x,y)\) that creates PSD matrix
\(K(j,j')\in\mathbb{S}^{n\times n}\). It says that such a PSD matrix can
always be decomposed into a form \(K=R^TR\) for any matrix
\(R(i,j)\in \mathbb{S}^{m\times n}\), thus letting us use the
polarization identity to create arbitrary distance metrics. on
\(\mathbb{S}^n\)
\autocite{SimilaritiesgraphsKernels_Avrachenkov2019}\footnote{ Distance
  metric, here, means that \(d(x,y)\) satisfies the triangle inequality
  for all \(x,y\).}
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-dist-kernel}{
d_K(j,j') = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(K(j,j)+K(j',j'))\right)-K(j,j')
}\end{equation}

This ability to create valid distance measures from arbitrary kernel
functions is the core of a vast area of machine learning and statistics
that employs the so-called \emph{kernel trick}. {[}CITE?{]} Different
kernels yield different properties useful for distinguishing points
having specific properties. One class of kernels are normalized to the
range \([0,1]\), such that we ensure that equality along any one
dimension is given a weight of \(\tilde{K}(j,j)=1\). Such a kernel
matrix can be derived from any other kernel, and is often combined with
a logarithmic similarity measure \(\tilde{\kappa}(x,y)=\log{s(x,y)}\).
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-norm-diag}{
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{K}(j,j') &= \frac{K(j,j')}{\sqrt{K(j,j)^2K(j',j')^2}}\\
d_{\tilde{K}}(j,j') &= -\log{\tilde{K}(j,j')}
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation} Since this is equivalent to applying
Equation~\ref{eq-dist-kernel} to \(s\) directly. This normalization
should be familiar as the way cosine similarities and correlation
matrices are made as well (also having 1s along their diagonal), and
illustrates how non-metric similarities can be potentially made into
(pseudo)metrics.

\subsection{Incidence structures \&
dependency}\label{incidence-structures-dependency}

Rather than how ``close'' or ``far'' to points are in vector space,
which is described with the kernels and distances above, whether
something ``touches''---or, is incident to---something else is usually
described abstractly as an \emph{incidence structure}. This is an
abstract way to describe how things ``touch'', such as when a set of
points lie on a line/plane, or nodes touch an edge. We say an incidence
structure is a triple of sets called (for historical reasons)
\emph{points} \(\mathfrak{P}\), \emph{lines} \(\mathfrak{L}\), and
\emph{flags} \(\mathfrak{I}\).\autocite{Incidencegeometry_Moorhouse2007}
\[(\mathfrak{P,L,I})\quad \mathfrak{I}\subseteq \mathfrak{P}\times\mathfrak{L}\]

Representing these as matrices will be further explored in
Section~\ref{sec-incidence-vec}. But, the discrete nature of these
incidence sets makes it clear that estimating the size and elements of
\(\mathfrak{I}\), is a very different question from estimating the
similarity/distance between two entities in a vector space.

In statistics, such discrete structures usually arise when we are
concerned with direct dependence from indirect. Take as an example a set
of masses connected together by springs. If we shake one mass, all
masses will also shake some amount, depending on the spring constants of
the springs each mass is ``transmitted'' force through, and the losses
due to friction or air resistance. While the amount of movement over
time depends on how ``close'' in this spring network two masses are, the
movement itself can only be transmitted through springs that the masses
are \emph{incident} to. Movement could be modeled through
similarity/distance measurements like correlation, since none of the
masses are independent (all move when any do), but incidence in terms of
spring force transmission is modeled in terms of conditional
(in)dependence. If we hold all but two masses still, and moving one
doesn't move the other, then we know they are conditionally independent:
no spring connects them!

This idea gets formalized as probabilistic graphical models, which are
networks that define ``incidence'' between two variables as conditional
dependence. Letting the random variables in the column-space of \(X\) be
\(A,B\) and the remaining columns be \(C=X(\cdot,J\setminus \{A,B\})\),
then \begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-cond-indep}{
P(A\cap B |C ) = P(A|C)P(B|C)\implies (A\perp B|C)\implies (A,B)\notin \mathfrak{I}
}\end{equation} for a set of incidences \(\mathfrak{I}\) defining a PGM
that was sampled as \(X\).

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

\chapter{Incidence through vector
representation}\label{incidence-through-vector-representation}

To provide a sufficiently rigorous foundation for network recovery from
binary occurrence, we will need a rigorous way to represent networks and
occurrences that lends itself to building structured ways both connect
to each other. We build on the incidence structure and matrix product
formalism from the previous chapter, introducing various ways to build
graphs as incidence structures that have direct representations as
matrices. This can be extended to representing occurrences as matrices
of \emph{hyperedge vectors}. This view allows us to interpret different
representations of graphs (or hypergraphs) as connected by simple matrix
operations.

Traditionally\autocite{MathematicalfoundationsGraphBLAS_Kepner2016,WhyHowWhen_Torres2021},
we might say a graph on nodes (or, ``vertices'')
\(v\in V=\{1,\cdots,n\}\) and ``edges'' \(E\) is a tuple: \[
G=(V,E) \quad \textrm{s.t.} \quad E\subseteq V \times V
\]

In incidence geometry terms, this would be similar to making two
duplicate sets of the same nodes, and defining a graph as the set of
incidences between nodes. The \emph{adjacency matrix} \(A\) of \(G\),
degree matrix \(D\), and graph/discrete Laplacian \(L\) are then defined
as:\footnote{ The \emph{indicator function} \(\mathbf{1}_A(x)\) is 1 for
  values of \(x\) in the set \(A\), and 0 otherwise.} \[
\begin{aligned}
A(u,v) & =\mathbf{1}_E((u,v)) \quad &A : V\times V\rightarrow \mathbb{B} \\
D(u,v) & =\mathrm{diag}({\textstyle\sum}_V A(u,v))\quad &D : V\times V\rightarrow \mathbb{N} \\
L(u,v) & = D(u,v) - A(u,v) \quad &L : V\times V\rightarrow \mathbb{Z} 
\end{aligned}
\]

However, if edges and their recovery is so important to us, defining
them explicitly as nodes-node incidences can be problematic when we wish
to estimate edge existence (or not), given noisy pairs of node
co-occurrences. Additionally, we have to be very careful to distinguish
whether our graph is \emph{(un)directed}, \emph{weighted},
\emph{simple}, etc., and hope that the edge set has been filtered to a
subset of \(N\times N\) for each case. Instead, we propose a less
ambiguous framework for vectorizing graphs, based on their underlying
incidence structure.

\section{Graphs as incidence structures}\label{sec-incidence-vec}

Instead, we give edges their own set of identifiers,
\(e\in E=\{1,\cdots \omega\}\). Now, define graphs as incidence
structures between nodes and edges such that every edge is incident to
either two nodes, or none:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-simple-incidence}{
G = (V,E,\mathcal{I}) \quad s.t. \quad \mathcal{I} \subseteq E\times V
}\end{equation}

Variations on graphs can often be conveniently defined as constraints on
\(\mathcal{I}\):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Self loops can be prohibited by only allowing unique flags for a given
  relation\footnote{ never two flags with the same pair,
    i.e.~\(\mathcal{I}\) is a set, not a multiset.}
\item
  Multigraphs are similarly described by whether we allow pairs of
  vertices to appear with more than one edge\footnote{ in the set of
    flags containing nodes \(u\) or \(v\), only one \(e\) may be
    incident to both of them.}
\end{itemize}

Together, these constraints define ``simple'' graphs. Similarly, we can
equip Equation~\ref{eq-simple-incidence} with a function \(B\) that
allows \(\mathcal{I}\) to encode information about the specific kinds of
incidence relations under discussion. We give \(B\) a range of possible
flag values \(S\):

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-map-incidence}{
G = (V,E,\mathcal{I},B) \quad s.t. \quad \mathcal{I} \subseteq E\times V\quad B:\mathcal{I}\rightarrow S
}\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Undirected, unweighted graphs only need single elements: ``incidence
  exists'' i.e.\(S=\{1\}\)
\item
  Directed graphs can use two elements e.g.~a ``spin'' for
  \(S=\{-1,1\}\)
\item
  Weighted, undirected graphs are supported on positive scalars
  e.g.~\(S=\mathbb{R}^+\)
\item
  Weighted, directed graphs are supported on any scalar
  e.g.~\(S=\mathbb{R}_{\neq0}\)
\end{itemize}

If the ``absence'' of incidence needs to be modeled explicitly, a
``null'' stand-in (0,False) can be added to each \(S\), which is useful
for representing each structure as arrays for use with linear algebra
(i.e.~\(\{0,1\}\),\(\{-1,0,-1\}\),\(\mathbb{R}^+_0\), and
\(\mathbb{R}\), respectively). By doing so, we can also place an exact
limit on the maximum possible size of \(\omega=\|E\|\) in the simple
graph case, and indicate edges by their unique ID, such that
\(\mathcal{I}= E\times V\) is no longer a subset relation for
\(E=\{1,\cdots,{n\choose2} \}\). Instead of existence in
\(\mathcal{I}\), we explicitly use incidence relation \(S\) to tell us
whether each possible edge ``exists'' or not, simplifying our graph
definition further\footnote{ if we allomulti-edges , then}:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-incidence-graph}{
\begin{gathered}
G  = (V,E,B) \quad s.t. \quad B : E\times V \rightarrow S\\
v \in V = \{1,\cdots, n\}\quad \\
e \in E = \left\{1,\cdots, {n\choose 2} \right\}
\end{gathered}
}\end{equation}

The representation of \(B\) in Equation~\ref{eq-incidence-graph} bears a
remarkable similarity to our original description of design matrices in
Equation~\ref{eq-design-mat}. In fact, as a matrix, \(B(e,v)\) is called
the \emph{incidence} matrix: every row has two non-zero entries, with
every column containing a number of non-zero entries equal to that
corresponding node's degree in \(G\). Traditionally, we use an
\emph{oriented} incidence matrix, such that each row has exactly one
positive (non-zero) value, and one negative (non-zero) value.\footnote{
  In fact, this would make B\^{}*(v,e) equivalent to a \emph{graphical
  matroid}, another common formalism that generalizes graph-like
  structures to vector space representations.} Even for undirected
graphs, the selection of \emph{which entry} is positive or negative is
left to be ambiguous, since much of the math used later is symmetric
w.r.t. direction\footnote{though not always!}.

\subsection{Embedding incidences in vector
space}\label{embedding-incidences-in-vector-space}

A formalism for graphs that starts with incidence matrices would benefit
from a \emph{canonical} oriented incidence matrix, rather than the
family that is ambiguous w.r.t. edge orientation. To start, we can be
more precise by selecting each row(edge) vector, and partitioning it
into two: one for each non-zero column (node) that edge is incident to.
Every incidence can be represented individually as standard basis vector
\(\mathbf{e}\) in the feature space of \(B\), scaled by the
corresponding value of \(S\).

Let \(V_e\) be the set of nodes with (non-zero) incidence to edge \(e\).
Then the incidence vectors are:\\
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-incidence-vec}{
\delta_e(v) = B(e,v)\mathbf{e}_v \quad \forall v\in V_e
}\end{equation} And the (unoriented) incidence matrix vectors are
recovered as sums over the incidence vectors for each edge:
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-incidence-edge-sum}{
\mathbf{b}_e = \sum_{v\in V_e} \delta_e(v)
}\end{equation}

A traditional approach might then define undirected graphs as
equivalent, in some sense, to multidigraphs, where each edge is really
two directed edges, in opposing directions. This does allow the matrix
\(B\) to have the correct range for its entries in this formalism (the
directed graph range, \(S=\{-1,0,1\}\)), and the edge identity based on
sums would hold. However, the resulting set of incidences would have
twice the number of edges than our combinatoric limit for simple graphs,
and prevent the more elegant definition of graph types through the set
\(\mathbf{S}\). Plus, it would necessitate averaging of weights over
different edge ID's to arrive at a single undirected ``edge weight'',
and many other implementation details that make keeping track of
specifics difficult for practitioners.

Instead, we would like a canonical oriented distance matrix, which can
be derived from the vectorized incidences in the undirected range of
\(B\) (the standard basis vectors). Without loss of generality, let
\(u_e,v_e\in V_e\) be nodes such that \(u<v\).\footnote{the inequality
  is strict because self-loops are not allowed.} Using this, we can
unambiguously define a \emph{partition}
\(B(e,\cdot)=B(e,u_e) + B(e,v_e)\) between incidences on \(e\), along
with a new derived incidence, \(B_o\), which has oriented rows like:
\[B_o(e,\cdot)=\mathbf{b}^o_e = \delta_e(u)-\delta_e(v)\] In other
words, while the unoriented incidence matrix is the ``foundational''
representation for graphs in our formalism, the (canonical) oriented one
can be derived, even if negative incidence values are not in
\(\mathbb{S}\).\footnote{ This works as long as we are in at least a
  ring, since semirings in general do not need to define additive
  inverse operations. In this case we would limit ourselves to the
  oriented incidence.}

But, now that we have removed the information on ``which nodes an edge
connects'' from our definition of edges (since every edge is a scalar
ID), how do we construct \(V_e\) without a circular dependency on \(B\)
to find non-zero entries? Because of our unique identification of edges
up to the combinatoric limit, we can still actually provide a unique
ordering of the nodes in \(V_e\), without searching over the entirety of
\(B\)'s domain. Using an identity from
\textcite{ParallelEuclideandistance_Angeletti2019}, we have a
closed-form equation both to retrieve the IDs of nodes \(u,v\) (given an
edge \(e\)), and an edge \(e\) (given two nodes \(u,v\)), for any simple
graph with \(n\) vertices.
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-sq-id}{
\begin{gathered}
    u_n(e) = n - 2 - \left\lfloor\frac{\sqrt{-8e + 4n(n - 1) - 7}-1}{2}\right\rfloor\\
    v_n(e) = e + u_n(e) + 1 -\frac{1}{2} \left(n (n - 1) + (n - u_n(e))^2 - n+u_n(e)\right)\\
    e_n(u,v) = \frac{1}{2}\left(n(n - 1) - ((n - u)^2 - n+u)\right) + v - u - 1
\end{gathered}
}\end{equation} Our ease-of-calculation lets us drop some of the excess
notation and refer to our (un)oriented incidence matrices in terms of
the incidences of each edge on their \(u\) or \(v\), directly. \[
B = B_u + B_e \qquad B_o \equiv B_u - B_v
\]

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Inner products on
\(B\)}{Inner products on B}}\label{inner-products-on-b}

With all of this background, the other representations of graphs can
seen as derivations from the canonical incidence matrices. The
Laplacian, which is usually introduced either in terms of
ajacency/degree, or as the gram matrix for oriented edge vectors, is
also related to the gram matrix between all pairs of incidences on
\((u,v)\). The other identities are simply consequences of the
polarization identity:
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-laplacian}{
\begin{split}
L & = B_o^TB_o\\
  & = \|B_u - B_v \|^2 \\
  & = 2\|B_u\|^2 +2\|B_v\|^2 - \|B_u + B_v \|^2 \\
  & = 2D - B^TB = D-A
\end{split}
}\end{equation}

The Laplacian is often used in defining random-walks and markov chains,
such that the degree of each node should be normalized to 1, which can
be accomplished either by row- or column-normalizing it:
\(L^{\textrm{rw}}=D^{-1}L\) or \(LD^{-1}\), respectively. If this
degree-normalization is desired without de-symmetrizing \(L\), we can
still perform an operation similar to normed kernels in
Equation~\ref{eq-norm-diag}, called the symmetric normalized Laplacian.
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-norm-laplacian}{
\tilde{L} = D^{-\tfrac{1}{2}}LD^{-\tfrac{1}{2}} = \frac{L(u,v)}{\sqrt{L(u,u)^2L(v,v)^2}}
}\end{equation}

\subsection{Edge Metrology, Edge
Vectors}\label{edge-metrology-edge-vectors}

Implicitly in the use of \(B\) with design matrix mechanics from the
previous chapter is a treatment of edges as ``observations'' (the data
space), and nodes as features. If an edge \emph{is} an observation, then
unfortunately we cannot really quantify uncertainty over repeated
measurements of edges with the simple mechanics from
Section~\ref{sec-counting} (because that edge \emph{is} that
corresponding observation, and IDs are not duplicated).

So far we have seen two ways of representing the entire graph in matrix
form: Incidence matrix \(B\) (or \(B_o\)), and the inner-product
matrices derived from it (\(L\), \(A\)). Since we can recover node IDs
from edge IDs by Equation~\ref{eq-sq-id}, we can use a single vector to
represent an entire graph structure by it's edges alone. Then a data
dimension for vectors in ``edge space'' can once again represent
observations, with nodes implied by Equation~\ref{eq-sq-id}. This is
either done by contracting \(B\) along the nodes (columns) dimension, or
by \emph{unrolling} the upper triangle of \(L\) or \(A\) according to
Equation~\ref{eq-sq-id}.\footnote{ Equation~\ref{eq-edge-vectors} uses
  an averaging operation to accomplish the contraction, but any
  reduction over the two nodes shared by an edge would accomplish the
  same, especially since we rarely see separate values for edge weight
  per-node, the way incidences can.} If each vector represents a value
of \(B\) associated with a corresponding edge, then \(m\) of these
vectors would be equivalent to \(m\) observations of \({n \choose 2}\)
edges on the same set of \(n\) nodes. Formally, for the \(i\)th observed
structure on \(n\) nodes:
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-edge-vectors}{
\begin{gathered}
R(i,e) = \min(\{B_i(e, u_n(e)),B_i(e,v_n(e))\}) \\
\quad \textrm{s.t.} \quad R:I\times E \rightarrow \mathbb{S}\\
i\in I = \{1,\cdots,m\} \qquad e \in E=\left\{1,\cdots,\omega\right\}\\
n=\tfrac{1}{2}(1+\sqrt{8\omega+1})
\end{gathered}
}\end{equation} This representation formalizes what practitioners call
``edgelists'' into a data structure that can unambiguously distinguish
directed, undirected, and weighted graphs. In addition, it allows for
repeated measurements of edges over the same set of nodes, while
flexibly growing when new nodes arrive.\footnote{ For instance, say
  observations are stored as sparse entries via \(R\), and a new node
  arrives. First, the participating nodes can be recovered in a
  vectorized manner through Equation~\ref{eq-sq-id}. Then, a new node id
  increases \(n\), followed by reassignment of the edge IDs with
  \(e_n(u,v)\).}

we can actually interpret ochiai/cosine as an approximate bayes update.

Say we observe binary variables A and B, along with others.

Now, we want a probability of conditional dependence between A and B
(does information flow directly between a and b when a and b happen
together?). So we want the probability ofand edge \(E_{ab}\) being used,
given that such an edge had the opportunity to be used. E.g. did two
people have a causal interraction to make each other sick, given a time
when we know they were both exposed/became sick.
\[P(E|O) = P(O|E)P(E)/P(O)\]

The denominator is hard, because while we can estimate the frequency of
each node as the occurrences/opportunities (i.e.~events/exposure), so,
\(n_i/N\), we can't use that for an exposure for ``number of times an
edge between A,B could have been used''. If we multiply \(N(a)N(b)\),
then we have the number of \emph{ways} a or b could be related over all
chances, but this won't be a fraction of the number of samples, and
could possible be much bigger. So dividing the number of times both
\emph{did} happen together by that number won't get us a probability. So
instead, we fib a bit.

The number of chances (out of all samples) that a pair had to happen
together is somewhere between the chances each had separately. We make a
pseudo-variable that uses this fact, but averaging the rates. but we are
dealing with probabilities, which are based around ``areas'' and their
ratios. So we want one count, such that watching it with a copy of
itself has the same exposure as watching A and B separately. This is
exaclty what geometric means are for:

Then, a point estimate for the probability of an edge occurring is its
actual co-ocurrence \(n_{a,b}/N\). It's the ratio of these that give us
the Ochiai as a probability: divided by the estimate for the
co-ocurrence opportunities

\chapter{Graph Reduce \& Desire Paths}\label{graph-reduce-desire-paths}

Addressing gaps discussed in the previous section to reach a generative
model for network recovery requires careful attention to the generation
mechanism for node activations. While there are many ways we might
imagine bipartite data to be be generated, presuming the existence of a
dependency graph that \emph{causes} activation patterns will give us
useful ways to narrow down the generative specification.

First, we will investigate the common assumption that pairwise
co-occurrences can serve as proxies for measuring relatedness, and how
this ``gambit of the group'' is, in fact, a strong bias toward dense,
clique-filled recovered networks. Because we wish to model our node
activations as being \emph{caused} by other nodes (that they depend on),
we draw a connection to a class of models for \emph{spreading}, or,
\emph{diffusive processes}. We outline how random-walks are related to
these diffusive models of graph traversal, enabled by an investigation
of the graph's ``regularized laplacian'' from
\textcite{Semisupervisedlearning_Avrachenkov2017}. Then we use the
implicit causal dependency tree structure of each observation, together
with the Matrix Forest Theorem
\autocite{MatrixForestTheorem_Chebotarev2006,Countingrootedforests_Knill2013}
to more generally define our generative node activation model. This
leads to a generative model for binary activation data as rooted random
spanning forests on the underlying dependency graph.

\section{The Gambit of the Inner
Product}\label{the-gambit-of-the-inner-product}

As we saw repeatedly in Chapter~\ref{sec-lit-review}, networks are
regularly assumed to arise from co-occurrences, whether directly as
counts or weighted in some way. This assumption can be a significant a
source of bias in the measurement of edges. \emph{Why} a flat count of
co-occurrence leads to ``hairballs'' and bias for dense clusters can be
related to the use of inner products on node activation vectors.

\subsection{Gambit of the Group}\label{gambit-of-the-group}

It seems reasonable, when interactions are unobserved, to assume some
evidence for all possible interactions is implied by co-occurrence.
However, similar to the use of uniform priors in other types of
inference, if we don't have a good reason to employ a fully-connected
co-occurrence prior on interaction dependencies, we are adding
systematic bias to our inference. Whether co-occurrence observations can
be used to infer interaction networks directly was discussed at length
in \textcite{Techniquesanalyzingvertebrate_Whitehead1999}, where
Whitehead and Dufault call this the \emph{gambit of the group}.

\begin{quote}
So, consiously or unconsciously, many ethnologists studying social
organization makr what might be called the ``gambit of the group'': the
assume that animals which are clustered {[}\ldots{]} are interacting
with one another and then use membership of the same cluster
{[}\ldots{]} to define association.
\end{quote}

This work was rediscovered in the context of measuring assortativity for
social networks,\footnote{Assortativity is, roughly, the correlation
  between node degree and the degrees of its neighbors.} where the
author of \textcite{PerceivedAssortativitySocial_Fisher2017} advises
that ``group-based methods'' can introduce sampling bias to the
calculation of assortativity, namely, systematic overestimation when the
sample count is low.

The general problems with failing to specify a model of what ``edges''
actually \emph{are} get analyzed in more depth in
\textcite{Statisticalinferencelinks_Peel2022}. They include a warning
not to naively use correlational measures with a threshold, since even
simple 3-node systems will easily yield false positives edges. Still, it
would be helpful for practitioners to have a more explicit mental model
of \emph{why} co-occurence-based models yield systematic bias,

\subsection{Inner-Product Projections and ``Clique
Bias''}\label{inner-product-projections-and-clique-bias}

Underlying correlation and co-occurrence models for edge strength is a
reliance on inner products between node occurrence vectors. They all use
gram matrices (or centered/scaled versions of them), which were brought
up in Section~\ref{sec-products}. The matrix multiplication performed
represents inner products between all pairs of feature vectors. For
\(X(i,j)\in\mathbb{B}\), these inner products sum together the times in
each observation that two nodes were activated together.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{index_files/mediabag/content/part2/2-01-rand-sf_files/figure-latex/..-codefigs-graphs-fig-stack-outerprod-output-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-stack-outerprod}Gram matrix as sum of observation
outer products}

\end{figure}%

However, another (equivalent) way to view matrix multiplication is as a
sum of outer products \[
G(j,j') = X^T X = \sum_{i=1}^m X(i,j)X(i,j')= \sum_{i=1}^m \mathbf{x}_i\mathbf{x}_i^T
\] Those outer products of binary vectors create \(m\times m\) matrices
that have a 1 in every \(i,j\) entry where nodes \(i,j\) both occurred,
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-stack-outerprod}. Each outer product is
effectively operating as a \(D_i+A_i\) with degrees normalized to 1. If
the off-diagonals can be seen as adjacency matrices, they would strictly
represent a clique on nodes activated in the \(i\)th observation In this
sense, any method that involves transforming or re-weighting a gram
matrix, is implicitly believing that the \(k\)th observation was a
\emph{complete graph}. This is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig-stacked-graphs}.

\begin{figure}

\begin{minipage}{0.33\linewidth}

\caption{\label{fig-stacked-graphs}Inner-product projections as sums of

\end{figure}%

For many modeling scenarios, this paradigm allows practitioners to make
a more straight-forward intuition-check: do clique observations
\emph{make sense} here? When a list of authors for a paper is finished,
does that imply that all authors mutually interacted with all others
directly to equally arrive at the decision to publish? This would be
similar to assuming the authors might simultaneously enter the same
room, look at a number of others (who all look exclusively at each
other, as well), and \emph{all at once} decide to publish together. In
our introduction, we described a more likely scenario we could expect
from an observer on the ground: a researcher asks a colleague or two to
collaborate, who might know a couple more with relevant expertise, and
so on.

\section{Networks as Desire Path Density
Estimates}\label{networks-as-desire-path-density-estimates}

Unfortunately, methods based on inner-product thresholding are still
incredibly common, in no small part due to how \emph{easy} it is to
create them from occurrence data, regardless of this ``clique-bias''.
The ability to map an operation onto every observation, e.g.~in
parallel, and then reduce all the observations into an aggregate edge
estimate is a highly desirable algorithmic trait. This may be a reason
so many projection and backboning techniques attempt two re-weight (but
retain) the same basic structure, time and again.

What we need is a way to maintain the ease-of-use of inner-product
network creation:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  map an operation onto each observation
\item
  reduce to an aggregate edge guess over all observations
\end{itemize}

but with a more domain-appropriate operator at the observation level.

Let's start with replacements for the clique assumption. There are many
non-clique classes of graphs we might believe local interactions occur
on: path-graphs, trees, or any number of graphs that reflect the topolgy
or mechanism of local interactions in our domain of interest. Authors
have proposed classes of graphs that mirror human perception of set
shapes {[}RELATIVE NEIGHBORHOOD{]}\footnote{ e.g.~for dependencies based
  on perception, such as human decision making tendencies, or causes
  based on color names.}, or graphs whose modeled dependencies are
strictly planar {[}planar maximally filtered graps{]}\footnote{
  e.g.~when interactions are limited to planar dependencies, like
  inferring ancient geographic borders.}. Alternatively, the
interactions might be scale free, small-world, trees, or samples from
stochastic block models.{[}CITE{]} In any case, these assumptions
provide an explicit way to describe the set of \emph{possible}
interaction graphs we believe our individual observations are sampled
from.

\subsection{Subgraph Distributions}\label{subgraph-distributions}

Let's use the notation from Equation~\ref{eq-edge-vectors}, such that
each observation of nodes \(\mathbf{x}_i\) is implicitly derived from a
set of activated edges \(\mathbf{r_i}\). To start, our current belief
about what overall structure the whole network can take is
\(G^*=(V,E,B^*)\), where \(B^*\) might always return \(1\) to start out
(the complete graph). To further constrain the problem, let us assume
that node activation is noiseless: any activated nodes were truly
activated, and unactivated nodes were truly inactive (no false negative
or false positive activations).\footnote{ Hidden nodes (unobserved nodes
  beyond the \(n\)) are outside the scope of this work, though could
  potentially be implied for certain structures e.g.~when the metric is
  known to be tree-like. \textcite{TreeIam_Sonthalia2020} use a greedy
  embedding that minimizes distortion to estimate the need for added
  \emph{Steiner} nodes.} So, each \(\mathbf{x}_i\) will induce a
subgraph \(g_i = G^*[V_i]\), where
\(V_i = \{v\in \mathcal{V} | X(i,\mathcal{V})=1\}\). Then, our domain
knowledge takes the form of a constraint on edges within that subgraph,
which will induce a family of subgraphs on \(g_i\). This family
\(\mathcal{C}_i\) belongs to the relevant class of graphs
\(\mathcal{C}\), limited to nodes \(V_i\), i.e.

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-subgraph-family}{
\begin{gathered}
\mathcal{C}_i = \{(V,E,B_i) \in\mathcal{C}|B_i(e,v)=B^*(e,v)\mathbf{1}_{V_i}(v)\mathbf{1}_{E_i}(e)\}\\
E_i\in\{\mathcal{E}\in\mathcal{P}(E)| g_i[\mathcal{E}]\in\mathcal{C}\}
V_i = \{v\in \mathcal{V} | X(i,\mathcal{V})=1\}
\end{gathered}
}\end{equation}\footnote{\(\mathcal{P}(A)\) is the \emph{powerset} of
  \(A\), i.e.~the set of all subsets of \(A\).}

In other words, the edges that ``caused'' to the node activations in a
given observation must \emph{together} belong to a graph that, in turn,
belongs to our desired class, which must occur on the nodes that were
activated.

Assuming we can define an associated measure \(\mu_i(c)\) onfor each
\(c\in\mathcal{C}_i\), we are able to define a probability distribution
over subgraphs in the class.\footnote{ This is certainly not a trivial
  assumption, and might either be ill-defined or require techniques like
  the Gumbel trick\autocite{GradientEstimationStochastic_Paulus2020} to
  approximate, unless the partition function \(\mathbb{Z}\) has a closed
  form, or \(\mu\) is already a probability measure on some
  \(\sigma\)-algebra over \(\mathcal{C}\). Closed-form \(\mathcal{Z}\)
  values on \(\mathcal{C}\) are known for a handful of graph classes,
  such as the space of spanning trees, \(\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{T}\).
  However, another way this might be accomplished is through random
  geometric graphs{[}CITE{]}, or geometric spanners like
  Urqhart{[}CITE{]} and Relative Neighborhood {[}CITE{]} graphs on a
  ``sprinkling'' of points that preserves their observed pairwise
  distances.\\
  This is further discussed in Section~\ref{sec-future-hyperbolic}.}
Using notation similar to distributions over spanning trees in
\textcite{EfficientComputationExpectations_Zmigrod2021}:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-subgraph-prob}{
\begin{gathered}
p_i(c) = \frac{\mu_i(c)}{\mathbb{Z}_i}\\
\mathbb{Z}_i = \sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_i} \mu_i(c)
\end{gathered}
}\end{equation}

This can be represented using the vectorization in
Equation~\ref{eq-edge-vectors}, due to the one-to-one correspondence
established, so that, with a slight abuse of notation treating
\(\mathcal{C}_i\) as the parameter of distribution \(p_i\):
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-edgevec-prob}{
\mathbf{r}_{i}(e)|\mathbf{x_i} \sim p_i(\mathcal{C},E,V)
}\end{equation}

So we may not have an exact vector, but we have established a way to
specify a family of edge vectors that could be responsible. With
\(p_i(c)\), we also have a mechanism to sample them when a partition
function is available (or able to be approximated).

With these mechanics in place, we see the choice of a clique (implied by
the inner product) is a trivial application of
Equation~\ref{eq-edgevec-prob}, since that is equivalent to selecting
the class of cliques on \(V_i\) nodes. This has only one element
(\(\|\mathcal{C}_{\text{clique}}\|=1\)), there is only 1 possible
selection, with probability \(p_i(K^{V_i})=1\).

\subsection{Graph Unions as Desire
Paths}\label{graph-unions-as-desire-paths}

With a distribution over subgraphs each observation, we are potentially
able to sambple from them for bootstrap or Monte Carlo estimation
purposes, or simply find a maximum likelihood estimate for each
distribution. Assuming this is true, we may now sample or approximate a
matrix \(R(i,e):I\times E \rightarrow \mathbb{B}\).\\
Methods for doing this efficiently in certain cases are the focus of
Section~\ref{sec-FP} and Section~\ref{sec-lfa-gibbs}. However, once
\(R(i,e)\) is estimated, a reasonable mechanism for estimating the
support of the set of edges is to use
\(\frac{\text{count}}{\text{exposure}}\), but with a few needed
modifications.

First, while the nodes counts in \(\sum_i B(i,\cdot)\) are by assumption
\emph{not} independent, or even pairwise independent, the \emph{edge
traversal} counts \(\sum_i R(i,\cdot)\) could more reasonably be
considered so. A model certainly could be constructed where edge
existence depends on other edges existing (or not). But nothing is
inherently self-inconsistent with a model that assumes the
traversability of individual edges will be independent of one another.

let P(e) be the probability that an edge is traversed (in any
observation), and P(u,v) the probability that nodes \(u,v\) co-occur. To
approximate the overall traversability of an edge, we can calculate an
empirical estimate for the conditional probability
\(P(e|(u,v))=\frac{P(e)\cap P(u,v)}{P(u,v)}\) that an edge is traversed,
given that the two incident nodes are activated. This estimate can use
the same beta-bernoulli distribution from
Equation~\ref{eq-beta-binomial}.

Still, how do we ensure our estimate is approximating traversability, so
that the probability that an edge probability converges toward 1 as long
as it \emph{has to be possible} for \(e\) to be traversed? Recall from
the introduction that, from a measurement perspective, the underlying
networks rarely ``exist'' in the sense that we never truly find the
underlying network, but only samples from (or caused by) it. Imagine
that the ``real'' network is a set of paved sidewalks: our procedure is
similar to watching people walk along paths between locations, and
wanting to estimate which of the paths would be tread ``enough'' to be
paved. This is where we build on an intuition based on the popular idea
of \emph{desire paths} which is a colloquial name for paths that form
when individuals walk over grass or dirt enough to carve a trail. In
network analysis and recovery, we usually are only allowed to see the
desire paths that might have formed from our data, never the actual
``pavement''.

If presented with two equivalent paths, an individual is likely to
choose the one that has been tread more often before i.e.~the ``more
beaten'' path. So, we don't want a probability that an edge has been
traversed, but a probability over fractions of the time we expect an
edge to have been traversed \emph{more often than not}: how likely it is
to ``be beaten''. This is accomplished by forcing \(\alpha, \beta < 1\).
For the case where \(\alpha=\beta=0.5\), we call this special case an
\emph{arcsine} distribution.

In a coin tossing game where each ``heads'' gives a point to player A
and ``tails'' to player B, then the point differential is modeled as a
random walk. The arcsine distribution
\(\text{Beta}(\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{2})\) is exactly the probability
distribution for the fraction of time we expect one player to be
``ahead'' of the other. \autocite{WhatisArcsine_Ackelsberg2018}

\begin{quote}
``\emph{Contrary to popular opinion, it is quite likely that in a long
coin-tossing game one of the players remains practically the whole time
on the winning side, the other on the losing side.''}

William Feller\autocite[Chapter
III]{IntroductionProbabilityTheory_Feller1968}
\end{quote}

This is desirable behavior for a distribution over edge traversability!
We expect the vast majority of edges to have a 0 or 1 as the most likely
values, with the expected fraction of observations that an edge being
traversed was ``ahead'' of it being \emph{not} traversed matching our
empirical count. We generalize this with \(\alpha = 1-\beta\), with
\(\alpha + \beta = 1\), such that the new beta posterior from
Equation~\ref{eq-beta-binomial} with \(s\) successes over \(k\) trials
is:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-desirepath-binom}{
\begin{gathered}
\pi \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha + c, 1-\alpha-c) \\
c = \frac{s-ak}{k+1}\\
\end{gathered}
}\end{equation}

Important to note is that \(k\) is measured over the
\emph{co-occurrences} \((u,v)\), and successes are the traversals \(e\)
derived from our samples in \(R\). This lets us formulate a likelihood
model for each edge's traversibility in the global network \(G\)
(i.e.~whether \(B(e,v)>0\) for any \(v\)), which is i.i.d. Bernoulli. \[
\begin{gathered}
\pi_e \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, 1-\alpha), e\in E\\ 
E \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\pi_e), e \in E
\end{gathered}
\]

This does not yet specify a likelihood for \(\mathcal{C}_i\), because we
have not included a mechanism for the down-selection to each
\(\mathbf{x}_i\). This will be addressed more completely for the special
case of \(\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{F}\), the set of spanning forests on a
graph, in Section~\ref{sec-lfa-like}. In general, however, failing to
specify the prior distribution on \(\mathcal{C}_i\) does not necessarily
make Equation~\ref{eq-edgevec-prob} unusable, but necessitates an
``empirical bayes'' approach. With the marginals and co-occurrence
counts for nonzero values in \(X\), we can make a point estimate for
each edge \emph{given} a node subset, without needing to consider a
prior distribution for each \(\mathbf{x_i}\).

The nonparametric approach, in cases that merit the use of spanning
trees, will be central to accurate, scalable estimation of \(B\) through
our proposed method, Forest Pursuit.

\section{Random Walks as Spanning
Forests}\label{random-walks-as-spanning-forests}

The class of diffusive processes we focus on ``spread'' from one node to
another. If a node is activated, it is able to activate other nodes it
is connected to, directly encoding our need for the graph edges to
represent that nodes ``depend'' on others to be activated. In this case,
a node activates when another node it depends on spreads their state to
it. These single-cause activations are equivalent to imagining a
random-walk on the dependency graph, where visiting a node activates it.

\subsection{Random Walk Activations}\label{random-walk-activations}

Random walks are regularly employed to model spreading and diffusive
processes on networks. If a network consists of locations, states,
agents, etc. as ``nodes'', and relationships between nodes as ``edges'',
then random walks consist of a stochastic process that ``visits'' nodes
by randomly ``walking'' between them along connecting edges.
Epidemiological models, cognitive search in semantic networks, stock
price influences, website traffic routing, social and information
cascades, and many other domains also involving complex systems, have
used the statistical framework of random walks to describe, alter, and
predict their behaviors. {[}CITE\ldots lots?{]}

When network structure is known, the dynamics of random-walks are used
to capture the network structure via sampling {[}LITTLEBALLOFFUR,
etc{]}, estimate node importance's{[}PAGERANK{]}, or predict
phase-changes in node states (e.g.~infected vs.~uninfected){[}SIR I
think{]}. In our case, Since we have been encoding the activations as
binary activation vectors, the ``jump'' information is
lost---activations are ``emitted'' for observation only upon the random
walker's initial visit. {[}CITE INVITE{]} In many cases, however, the
existence of relationships is not known already, and analysts might
\emph{assume} their data was generated by random-walk-like processes,
and want to use that knowledge to estimate the underlying structure of
the relationships between nodes.
