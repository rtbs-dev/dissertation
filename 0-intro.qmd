# Introduction


## Measuring relations through observation

We're interested in figuring out how "stuff" is connected to other "stuff" by watching the behavior of "stuff" with other "stuff".


### Observation and Feature "Space"

Encode measurements in _design matrix_.

Rows and columns depend on domain...we chose one. 

### Model, Data, & Linear Operators

Forward model/operator maps model into data space, vs. Adjoint Model/Operator maps data into model space.
Inverse problems involve removing the effect of the operator $A$ from the data $y$  to recover the model $x$. 

### Measurement Quantification & Error 

- type I and II Error
- Epistemic and Alleatoric Uncertainty

Ultimately we are not great at specifying what "being related" actually means...


## What does "relation" mean?

### Incidence & Dependency

foundational model of graph theory and incidence structures more broadly.
More to come, but get the terminology down.

Spring example, road example, etc.
Discuss Complex Systems and their representation. 


### Proximities, Distances, & Kernels 

How "close" or "far away" things are.... Avrachenkov et al. 


Important: these measurements often assume distance is defined in terms of the measurements/objects/data, but for _inverse problems_, structure learning, etc., they are more often applied in terms of the features/operators.

Example with doc-term matrices 

### Ambiguity or Causality
Usually dependencies are taken as causing or enabling proximity.
E.g. shortest paths, vs. edges.


The approach taken by researchers/investigators...do they assume a level of interchangeability between the two kinds of "relation"?
Do they define
Or do they
