# Introduction

A wide variety of fields show consistent interest in inferring latent network structure from observed interactions, from human cognition and social infection networks, to marketing, traffic, finance, and many others. [@Inferringnetworksdiffusion_GomezRodriguez2012]
However, an increasing number of authors are noting a lack of agreement in how to approach the metrology of this problem. 
This includes rampant disconnects between the theoretical and methodological network analysis sub-communities[@Statisticalinferencelinks_Peel2022], treatment of error as purely aleatory, rather than epistemic [@Measurementerrornetwork_Wang2012], or simply ignoring measurement error in network reconstruction entirely[@ReconstructingNetworksUnknown_Peixoto2018].

Networks in the "wild" rarely exist of and by themsleves. 
Rather, they are a model of interaction or relation _between_ things that were observed.
One of the most beloved examples of a network, the famed _Zachary's Karate Club_[CITE], is in fact reported as a list of pairwise interactions: every time a club member interacted with another (outside of the club), Zachary recorded it as two integers (the IDs of the members).
The final list of pairs can be _interpreted_ as an "edge list", which can be modeled with a network: a simple graph.
This was famously used to show natural community structure that nicely matches the group separation that eventually took place when the club split into two.[CITE]

Note, however, that we could have just as easily taken note of the instigating student for each interaction (i.e. which student initiated conversation, or invited the other to socialize, etc.).
If that relational asymmetry is available, our "edges" are now _directed_, and we might be able to ask questions about the rates that certain students are asked vs. do the asking, and what that implies about group cohesion.
Additionally, the time span is assumed to be "for the duration of observation" (did the students _ever_ interact), but if observation time was significantly longer, say, multiple years, we might question the credulity of treating a social interaction 2 years ago as equally important to an interaction immediately preceding the split.
This is now a "dynamic" graph; or, if we only measure relative to the time of separation, at the very least a "weighted" one.  

_We do not know if any of these are true_.
In fact, do to ambiguous reporting in the original work, we do not know if the network being described from the original edge data even has 77 or 78 edges.
Lacking a precise definition of what the graph's components (i.e. it's edges) are, _as measurable entities_, means we cannot estimate the measurement error in the graph.

To begin adressing these issues, this introductory section returns to foundational statistical measurment concepts and terminology, while clarifying each concepts potential relationships to the problems of network structure metrology.  
First, what "measurement" means in this context, and specifically the ways we encode observations, operations, and uncertainties numerically.
Second, what "relation" means, since network structure is intended to encode such relations as a mathematical object, despite common ambiguities and confusion around what practitioners intend on communicating through them.
