# Introduction

A wide variety of fields show consistent interest in inferring latent network structure from observed interactions, from human cognition and social infection networks, to marketing, traffic, finance, and many others. [@Inferringnetworksdiffusion_GomezRodriguez2012]
However, an increasing number of authors are noting a lack of agreement in how to approach the metrology of this problem. 
This includes rampant disconnects between the theoretical and methodological network analysis sub-communities[@Statisticalinferencelinks_Peel2022], treatment of error as purely aleatory, rather than epistemic [@Measurementerrornetwork_Wang2012], or simply ignoring measurement error in network reconstruction entirely[@ReconstructingNetworksUnknown_Peixoto2018].

To begin adressing these issues, this introductory section returns to foundational statistical measurment concepts and terminology, while clarifying each concepts potential relationships to the problems of network structure metrology.  
First, what "measurement" means in this context, and specifically the ways we encode observations, operations, and uncertainties numerically.
Second, what "relation" means, since network structure is intended to encode such relations as a mathematical object, despite common ambiguities and confusion around what practitioners intend on communicating through them. 


## Measuring relations through observation

We're interested in figuring out how "stuff" is connected to other "stuff" by watching the behavior of "stuff" with other "stuff".

### Observation and Feature "Space"

Encode measurements in _design matrix_.

Rows and columns depend on domain...we chose one. 

### Model, Data, & Linear Operators

Forward model/operator maps model into data space, vs. Adjoint Model/Operator maps data into model space.
Inverse problems involve removing the effect of the operator $A$ from the data $y$  to recover the model $x$. 

### Measurement Quantification & Error 

- type I and II Error
- Epistemic and Alleatoric Uncertainty

Ultimately we are not great at specifying what "being related" actually means...


## What does "relation" mean?

### Incidence & Dependency

foundational model of graph theory and incidence structures more broadly.
More to come, but get the terminology down.

Spring example, road example, etc.
Discuss Complex Systems and their representation. 


### Proximities, Distances, & Kernels 

How "close" or "far away" things are.... Avrachenkov et al. 


Important: these measurements often assume distance is defined in terms of the measurements/objects/data, but for _inverse problems_, structure learning, etc., they are more often applied in terms of the features/operators.

Example with doc-term matrices 

### Ambiguity or Causality
Usually dependencies are taken as causing or enabling proximity.
E.g. shortest paths, vs. edges.


The approach taken by researchers/investigators...do they assume a level of interchangeability between the two kinds of "relation"?
Do they define
Or do they
