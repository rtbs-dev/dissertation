# Qualitative Application of Relationship Recovery

A more realistic test of _Forest Pursuit's_ behavior is in unsupervised, qualitative analysis of complex systems and networks.
In this chapter we will recreate two well-known bipartite datasets from network science, and compare several network recreation methods on them.
As we have discussed previously[@PerceivedAssortativitySocial_Fisher2017], there is some interest in quantifying network assortativity for social networks, and whether the positive assortativity effect is a methodological artifact.
Assuming an analyst is interested in social network _dependencies_---like which nodes are directly _influencing_ which others---we provide a glimpse at how correcting for clique bias with _Forest Pursuit_ (FP) affects assortativity. 

In the second case study, we also investigate how centrality measures can be adversely affected when clique-bias is not accounted for, especially when appearance in cliques is known to be rare for certain node types. 


## Network Science Collaboration Network

Following in the steps of @Findingevaluatingcommunity_Newman2004, we recreate a network from co-authorships in works cited by two literature review papers, @StructureFunctionComplex_Newman2003 and [CITE].
The list of all cited papers was reconstructed via web-of-science queries, and these were used to construct author "activation" observations.^[
  An additional paper (@Coherentnoisescale_Sneppen1997) was added to ensure the the largest connected component contained necessary communities that were originally missing compared to @Findingevaluatingcommunity_Newman2004.
]
A baseline co-authorship network was initially constructed using the largest connected component, and a modularity-maximizing community detection algorithm [@Findingcommunitystructure_Clauset2004;Findingevaluatingcommunity_Newman2004] was used to highlight community structure.
Nodes and papers were retained if they had two or more papers and authors listed, respectively. 
This baseline network can be seen in @fig-netsci-cooc, where (to keep with the treatment in @Findingevaluatingcommunity_Newman2004) we have added a quotient network of the communities themselves.

{{< embed ../codefigs/qualitative.qmd#fig-netsci-cooc >}}

The detected assortativity $r=0.059$ is small, but positive.
As expected, each community tends to have a dominant "clique", since many members of these groups tend to mutually author papers together (simultaneously). 

However, if we are after a "social network" that describes social influence of individuals w.r.t. others, then we are hoping to recover collaborative _dependency relationships_.

- Who is causing who to join papers?
- Who are the central "collaborators" that influence the paper writing of many others?

With some background knowledge of how university labs tend to work (with students, post-docs, advisors, colleagues, etc.), we might not believe that every member of a community has significant influence on the writing of every other member. 
So, to estimate a dependency network of collaboration relationships, we could turn to a Chow-Liu tree, which is shown in @fig-netsci-tree.

{{< embed ../codefigs/qualitative.qmd#fig-netsci-tree >}}

This dependency is much more sparse, and indeed the assortativity coefficient has dropped to $r=-0.251$.
In academic writing, we might even expect a lowered assortativity, since students that may not go on to be prolific in their original field would still seek out prolific advisors, initially.
Unfortunately, enforcing a tree structure has some negative side effects. 
Overlaying the original community structure from @fig-netsci-cooc onto the tree and calculating a quotient graph shows that the community structure is impacted by the change.
Many of the communities are "unrolled" into long chains of authors, since trees cannot allow small loops or cycles. 
This makes for a shortest-path distance between community hubs (in the same field) to be upwards of 9-10 jumps, which goes against the scale-free/small-world nature we expect from social systems. 

With _Forest Pursuit_, we can attempt to correct for "clique bias" in the measurement of dependency relationships, while allowing for flexibility in the global network structure.
The FP recovered collaborator graph is shown in @fig-netsci-fp.  

{{< embed ../codefigs/qualitative.qmd#fig-netsci-fp >}}

The communities from the co-occurrence network are entirely preserved, with a nearly identical community structure in the graph quotient compared to the co-occurrence graph.
But now we see an assortativity that is close to zero (slightly negative at $r=-0.069$).
This brings the assortativity more in line with the World Wide Web networks, or even close to results for random preferential attachment networks that are zero in the limit[@AssortativeMixingNetworks_Newman2002].

Relative to the tree network, there are not so many long chains, as many authors have been allowed to "loop-back" and have relationships with nearby colleagues, reducing the path distance between communities in the process.
Still, like the trees, FP tends to reduce the degree of each node, which is summarized in @fig-netsci-degree. 

{{< embed ../codefigs/qualitative.qmd#fig-netsci-degree >}}

From a domain modeling perspective, it might be reasonable to assume that any given author has 2-3 influential collaboration relationships shown, especially considering students and post-docs are likely to constitute a good number of nodes.
Even from a logistics perspective (during a given time window working with an advisor) the number of times a student asks/is asked to participate in a paper has to be limited, given average publishing rates.  
Only rare individuals would have upwards of 10 influential relationships, with a mean closer to the 2-3 of the FP network, rather than a full quarter having 10 and the median being 4-5 (as in the co-occurrence network). 
In addition, recall that this is a social network derived from literature review paper citations, not exhaustive inventories of each author's work, so every influential relationship should not be shown in this sample.


## Les Miserables Character Network

Another famous network derives from @StanfordGraphBaseplatform_Knuth1993 via mining character co-occurrences in chapters of _Les Mis√©rables_ (1862), Victor Hugo's sprawling saga of [in]equality and [in]justice in 19th-century France.
This dataset is often reported as being inherently a _graph_, but we have reconstructed the underlying bipartite observations for the purpose of removing clique bias from the network reconstruction.
In the original network, an extra count is added to the weight of an edge every time a character occurs in a chapter with another.
Once again, we have only retained characters/chapters that appeared with two or more chapters/characters, respectively.
In @fig-lesmis-cooc, we run the same community detection scheme to improve the visual understandability of the network, along with inset quotient graphs.

{{< embed ../codefigs/qualitative.qmd#fig-lesmis-cooc >}}

Note that the communities demonstrate clear clique-like behavior.
On one hand, this does make assessment of clusters easier, since characters in roughly the same scenes are densely grouped together.
However, this network makes it difficult to parse relationships, such that backboning would become necessary.

We should also ask _what we want_ out of this "social" network.
Another way we might think about a social network of characters is "which characters _influence_ the appearance (or not) of which other characters?"
By extension, "which characters are _significant_, in the sense that they dictate the appearance of more characters than others?" 
From a domain modeling perspective, this is like asking _how_ an author is deciding which characters to include in a chapter.
By not correcting for clique-bias, we are implicitly assuming that Victor Hugo would be setting out to write a chapter and immediately writes down a list of every character, independently, should appear.
Instead, it's likely that the desired appearance of certain characters in a chapter _leads to_ the inclusion of others, as the plot requires. 

Because the inclusion of certain characters _leads to_ the inclusion of others (by this model), we can reasonably model the authorial "character inclusion process" as _spreading_ from character to character.
With this in mind, we apply Forest Pursuit to correct for clique-bias, and show the resulting dependency network (with the original community partition) in @fig-lesmis-fp.

{{< embed ../codefigs/qualitative.qmd#fig-lesmis-fp >}}

The network has been filtered to only include necessary edges to retain overall connectivity.
As before, our community structure shown in the quotient graph has been preserved, even with the significant edge density reduction.

Applying these networks, we might wish to distinguish through them which characters are "main" and which are "supporting", though more on a gradient than in a binary/classification sense. 
One way to do this is through centrality measures [CITE], which estimate the "importance" of nodes in various ways.
Eigenvector centrality, specifically, finds the importance of nodes relative to the importance of each node's neighbors^[
  Regularized eigenvector centrality is equivalent to PageRank centrality, _i.e._ the seminal work from [CITE], of Google fame.
]

The topology of a network greatly impacts the centrality measure recovered.
In @fig-lesmis-centrality we show a bump-plot of the ranks of the top 15 most central nodes for both the original co-occurrence network and the FP network estimate.
In the original network, centrality rewards characters appearing in mutual cliques as being central, especially the "revolutionary" group (shown in orange in @fig-lesmis-fp and @fig-lesmis-cooc).
Are these really the most important characters?
Even Javert, though being an important recurring character, largely plays the role of generic law enforcement throughout, while characters like Marius play central motivating roles across several distinct social groups throughout the novel.

{{< embed ../codefigs/qualitative.qmd#fig-lesmis-centrality >}}

This brings up another benefit of correcting clique-bias: estimating character importance _despite_ systematic interaction-reduction bias from authors. 
As made famous by the so-called "Bechdel test" [CITE], authors historically tend to systematically reduce the agency and interaction rates of women in literature[@genderagencygap_Stuhler2024].
We highlight every female character in @fig-lesmis-centrality, and which shows that the co-occurrence network had a single female character in the top 15 most central (Eponine, ranked 14th).
By correcting for clique-bias, _every_ female character significantly increases in centrality ranking.
In context, titles of entire books and volumes of _Les Mis√©rables_ are named after women we would consider crucial to the plot (_e.g._ Fantine, Cosette, and Eponine).  
As @genderagencygap_Stuhler2024 indicates, however, authors are likely to under-represent their agency and interactions with other characters throughout the story, so networks based primarily on co-occurrence will likewise systematically underestimate their importance.
