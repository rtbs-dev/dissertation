# Roads to Network Recovery {#sec-lit-review}

## Organizing Recovery Methods

i.e. Network Recovery as an Inverse Problem, and what information is had at each point. 


- Observing Nodes vs Edges
- Embeddings and Inner Products
- Preprocessing


## Counting, Projection, and Co-Occurrence
Basic Co-occurrence, and friends.
Gram is uncentered covariance. 

All estimate some kind of rate

### Cosine Similarity

- Ochiai and uncentered correlation
- angles don't care about length
- geometric mean on cond prob, actually
- that means pseudocounts can make sense

### Hyperbolic Projection

- reweights by degree in original BP
- mention other ways 

### Transformations of Counts

Come from contingency tables, like CS.

- odds-ratio
- Yule's Q,Y
- Mutual Info

## Resource and Information Flow

Backboning

Intuition that the most important edges are on geodesics for many paths

### Resource Projection

### Doubly-stochastic and eOT

### HSS

## Inverse Problems & PGM Structure

### Chow Liu
Global Tree structure from MI

### Shrinkage & GLASSO

### stability selection 

> Takeaway: a way to organize existing algorithms, AND highlight unique set of problems we set out to solve


## A Path Forward

### Tracing Information Loss Paths

![Relating Graphs and Hypergraph/bipartite structures as adjoint operators](../images/adjoint-cheatsheet.png)

Table of Existing Approaches  

- Observation-level loss (starting with the inner product or kernel)
- Non-generative model loss (no projection of data into model space)
- no uncertainty quantification 

### Something New

Sorting algorithms... _none address all three!_


i.e. MOTIVATES FOREST PURSUIT
