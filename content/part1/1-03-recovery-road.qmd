# Roads to Network Recovery {#sec-lit-review}

## Choosing a structure recovery method



> Takeaway: a way to organize existing algorithms, AND highlight unique set of problems we set out to solve


## Organizing Recovery Methods

i.e. Network Recovery as an Inverse Problem, and what information is had at each point. 

![Relating Graphs and Hypergraph/bipartite structures as adjoint operators](../images/adjoint-cheatsheet.png)

### Observing Nodes vs Edges

### Embeddings, Inner Products, & Preprocessing



## Tracing Information Loss Paths

### Table of Existing Approaches  

- Observation-level loss (starting with the inner product or kernel)
- Non-generative model loss (no projection of data into model space)
- no uncertainty quantification 


### A Path Forward

Sorting algorithms... _none address all three!_


i.e. MOTIVATES FOREST PURSUIT
