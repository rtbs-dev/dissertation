# Incidence in Vector Space

From [@WhyHowWhen_Torres2021], and linalg book, and hypergraph incidence model

For each, describe the meaning of

1. Observation model (and connection to node activation data)
1. Vector space representation
1. Inner product (linear kernel)
1. Induced Norms

## Dependence as Graph

Initial notation (set-based) and outline of section

![Edge Relation Observational Model](../images/relation-observations.png)

### Edges as Vectors of Nodes 

### Inner Product on Edges

Laplacian as inner product on incidence observations.
Associated objects (degree vector, o)

Rescaling to achieve normaalization.

Use to define kernels (and application e.g. soft-cosine measure)


### From Edge Observations to Node Activations 

Strictly speaking, we can't say that nodes are directly observed in this space... edges are.
Collections of nodes are measured two-at-a-time (one-per-edge being traversed).

Another way to approach is to view inner products as a sum of outer products.
A each edge uniquely corresponds to 2 nodes (in a simple graph).
Use triangle unfolding for closed form bijection.

Unrolling 3D tensor of subgraphs along eads to a secondary representation of graphs as an _edgelist_, having binary activation vectors on edges rather than nodes.
Then each observation in this model is necessarily a set of activated edges.
The non-zero (visited) nodes are found using the incidence matrix as an operator. 


## Occurence as Hypergraph

### Hyperedges as Vectors of Nodes

### Inner product on Hyperedges
Roundabout way of describing binary/occurrence data.
Inner product is co-occurrences.

Leads to correlation/covariance, etc. 


## Combining Occurence & Dependence

- soft cosine
- kernels on graphs (incl. coscia euclidean)
- Retrieving one from the other is hard.
