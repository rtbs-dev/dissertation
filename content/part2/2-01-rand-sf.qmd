# Random Spanning Forests

## Node Activation by Diffusive Processes 


Random walks are regularly employed to model spreading and diffusive processes on networks.
If a network consists of locations, states, agents, etc. as "nodes", and relationships between nodes as "edges", then random walks consist of a stochastic process that "visits" nodes by randomly "walking" between them along connecting edges.
Epidemiological models, cognitive search in semantic networks, stock price influences, website traffic routing, social and information cascades, and many other domains also involving complex systems, have used the statistical framework of random walks to describe, alter, and predict their behaviors.
If a network structure is known ahead of time, the dynamics of random-walks might be used to capture the network structure via sampling, estimate node importance's, or predict phase-changes in node states (e.g. infected vs. uninfected)

In many cases, however, the existence of relationships is not known already, and analysts might *assume* their data was generated by random-walk-like processes, and want to use that knowledge to estimate the underlying structure of the relationships between nodes.
