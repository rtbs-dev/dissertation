# LFA: Latent Forest Allocation 

## Radom Spanning Trees

- Methods for sampling i.e. wilson's and Duan's (other? Energy paper?)
- Tree Likelihoods, other facts 

## Bayesian Estimation by Gibbs Sampling 

- comparison with LDA
- Simplifying Assumptions (conditional prob IS prob for this)


I.e. the unwritten paper, modifying technique by @BayesianSpanningTree_Duan2021 for RSF instead of RSTs
